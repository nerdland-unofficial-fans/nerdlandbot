# nerdlandbot
This is a Python-based discord bot developed by the nerdland fan community.

# Roadmap
This bot was setup mostly as an experiment, and there is no clearly defined goal so far.
If you have any suggestions feel free to log an issue in this repository, any new ideas or challenges are much appreciated.

# Getting started
To get this project up and running, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3
- PIP

Once you have these installed (you can check by running 'python --version' and 'pip -V' in a commandline) run the following commands to install the required packages:
```
pip install python-dotenv
pip install discord-py
```

You will also need to acquire a DISCORD_TOKEN for this to work. You can get a new token by creating a new developer account on github.

You can now run the bot by running the following command with the src folder active
```
python main.py
```
